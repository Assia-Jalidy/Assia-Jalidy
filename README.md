## 💼 Professional Profile

I started my journey in data through multiple internships that gave me hands-on experience across analytics, machine learning, and business insights.  I then transitioned into my first professional role — a 6-month CDD as a **Data Analyst** — where I worked on real-world datasets, built dashboards, and helped turn data into smart decisions.

Today, I’m building my path as a Data Scientist, with a passion for solving real problems through data and AI.

🧠 I specialize in NLP, computer vision, and predictive modeling  
☁️ I work with big data tools, cloud platforms & scalable pipelines  
📊 I love turning complex data into clear, visual insights

I'm always looking to grow, create impact, and be part of bold, data-driven projects.
